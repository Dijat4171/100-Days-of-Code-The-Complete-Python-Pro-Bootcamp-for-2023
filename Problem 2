#In the end of the course, I made tip calculator. Below the code that I made.

print("Welcome to the tip calculator.")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
percen = float(input("What percentage tip wpuld you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? "))
split = input("How many people to split the bill? ")
money = round((bill+percen*bill/100)/int(split), 2)
money_new = format(money,'.2f')
pay = print(f"Each person should pay: {money_new}")
